# PIC18F4620 Embedded System Drivers & Applications

This repository contains a comprehensive set of drivers and embedded applications built for the **PIC18F4620** microcontroller. It includes full implementations of **MCAL (Microcontroller Abstraction Layer)** drivers, along with various **ECU (Electronic Control Unit)** drivers for external modules like LCDs, motors, sensors, and I2C devices. The goal is to provide a modular and reusable driver library for embedded systems projects.

## üîß Layers & Architecture

This project follows a layered architecture:

- **MCAL (Microcontroller Abstraction Layer):**  
  Fully implemented low-level drivers for all key PIC18F4620 peripherals:
  - DIO (Digital Input/Output)
  - Timers
  - External Interrupts
  - ADC
  - I2C (Master Mode)
  - USART
  - EEPROM
  - CCP (PWM and Capture)
  - Watchdog Timer
  - Oscillator Configuration

- **ECUAL (ECU Abstraction Layer):**  
  High-level drivers built on top of MCAL to interface with real-world modules.
